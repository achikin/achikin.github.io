Hi! My name is Anton Chikin and I develop software. I live in Russia and work remotely. I prefer to work with Clojure/ClojureScript but also proficient in Ruby, Java and Javascript. Sometimes, when it's not too cold and snowy outside, I go skydiving.
I did a lot of other interesting things once in a while, but now I'm focused on my family, my daily job and my pet projects.
